# Labolatory-Escape
Small game project made with Unity, nothing special but gives opportunity to learn about usage of delegates and events and other procedures.
Durning making this game I've used Unity 3D 2019.3.15f1

Previous versions of this game owned both levels. I've decided to abandon this project for now because of time constraints and change of priorities. Small changes will appear from time to time when I will have more time (and strenght to do it).

Software used during making requirements for the game:
- Blumind (mind map) - This software allowed me to make mind map which gave me option to make new ideas and make visual representation for later.
- Task Coach (to-do list) - Because of constant problem with internet durning making this project I've decided to go with more local to-do list instead of kanban boards like Trello (there were tries to make Wekan work locally).
